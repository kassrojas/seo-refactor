# SEO-Refactor

## Description

The goal of this SEO refactor project was to improve the accessibility features of the Horiseon Search Engine Optimization webpage as well as fixing any broken links while continuing to follow best practices of quality commenting and easier to read code. Improving accessibility creates opportunities for more users to visit the site with ease. Simple additions like a:hover with underlining option allows users to hover over a link and notice a change so that the user has a better idea of their cursor location. A website title was added as to optimize search engine results to the Horiseon webpage. Cleaner code makes it easier for any future collaborators to add or remove features with less confusion.
